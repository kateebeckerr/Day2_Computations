# Making and indexing data in R 

### Vectors 

Making vectors

```{r}
#c combiens these strings teddy/...
dogs <- c("teddy", "khora", "waffle", "banjo", "tallie" )

#check dog class, run these! prob do in console
typeof(dogs)
class(dogs)

#vector can only have data of a singletype otherwise will all be oerced into save


```

```{r}
my_breakfast <- c("waffles", 2, TRUE, "coffee")
typeof(my_breakfast)
#entire vector is character bc can only have a single type of variables, waffles 2 and true are different variables but stored as characters to be part of single vector 
class(my_breakfast)
```

```{r}
#numebrsof different types, numeric, teddy is 50 pounds, khora is 60...
weights <- c(50, 60, 25, 35, 55)
#looks liek integer
typeof(weights)
#comes up as double, higehr 64 bit storage for values, whole numebrb values will default to dooubles, numebrs tht can have decimals when you do calcualtions
class(weights)
#numeric
```

```{r}
weights_integer <- c(50L, 60L, 25L, 35L, 55L)
typeof(weights_integer) 
#integer 
class(weights_integer)
#integer still numeric 
```

```{r}
#overarching class of things can ask questions, ask question returns string, what is class of vector weights, waht as logical if  nuemric keep and not throw it out if nuemric coerce to string or not, binary question to ask if condition is met 
#ask questionsif numeric or cahracter "is." are askignna  questions
is.numeric(weights_integer)
#returned true so know tis numeric
```

```{r}
#change class of a variable such as weights liek 50,60, 25 (numeric) store new version with characters...
zipcode <- c(93105, 93514, 93101, 93401)
#r udnerstadns these as a number not zip
class(zipcode)

```

```{r}
#same things you can use add on you can use is
zipcodes_chr <- as.character(zipcode)
#now strings, cataegories, not numeric values associated with them 
# use as. family of functions to recast data classes
# use is. family fucntions to ask waht class something is 
#nuemric can be numeric or double jsut class jsut returns numeic for doubles, use class, less interested in knowing float/double/integer 

```

### Create a vector with named elements 

```{r}
#named elements within vectors or lists, still a vector use c
dog_food <- c(teddy = "purina", khora = "alpo",waffle = "fancy feast", bango = "blue diamond", tallie = "Farmer's dog")
#order dependant, name tacked onto vector , class refers to values not names 
is.character(dog_food)
#True 
test <- c(cat = 4, dog = 10, elephant = 11)
class(test)
#numeric , quoations would say its a character, a value with a stored name but name isnt a vector value
```

```{r}
#vector of data is whole column in dataframe, pick pieces out of dataframe
#elements are separated by comma, value of element is string value, what is value of (Dog name): square brackets immediately follows vector name
dog_food[2]
#R uses 1 index, first element of vector gives positional value of 1
#pythoon and java script use 0 idnexing, 2nd position on these platforms its 1 
```

```{r}
#elemnts of vector-1D of valuels, if named call name, msot dont have name associated with him 
dog_food["khora"]
```

### Access ranges of values in a vector 

Use : to refer to a range(low : high) by position

```{r}
trees <- c("ponderosa", "lodgepole", "jeffrey", "sugar", "white", "bristlecone")
trees[3]

#range from 3 to 5, 3 how far youve moved on from starting point
trees[3:5]

```

### Warm -up for loops

```{r}
# for loops iterates over different telements in a data structure, applies does something with vallues and returns something mew 
#use index to iterate through different vectors 
#been referring to absolute liek elen t2 but can ahveb evcor values to iterate over 
```

```{r}
#use index helper, i, writtign for loops
i <- 4
trees[i] 
#came out sugar
# index mgith be changing, iterate over multipe idnexes by position returnign something for each one 
i <- 3 
trees[i]
```

```{r}
#writting seq code we used/ same thing as seq(from =1, to =3)
i <- seq(1:3)
trees[i]

```

```{r}
#dont normal deal with complex numbers
y = 6i
class(y)
```

```{r}
#variable doesnt matter for for loops 
yoda <- 4
trees[yoda]
```

```{r}
#when you render something liek quarto r markdown, takes file to new black working section, doesnt last, moves and evaluates in empty session running from top down, linear, woudl this work in a new working session, rendering puts code et new working session to reproduce 
```

```{r}
#mutable you can change what you store in a vector 
trees[3] <- "OAK"

#can reassign values based on position 
trees
```

```{r}
#weve been working on same branch locally and pushing to remote main branch, then pulling down to local branch 
#have website or app, where its deploying from like website is main branch, iteraitngon stuff pushign to maiin branch wehn you push, push you udpate your web page, workign on soething but want it obe stored but dont want it to be stored 
#dont wanna pus frequently updatnig to branch everyones working 
# workign with rbanches creates additional sdie channel so were not pushing or pulling from main creates intermediate place to work 

```

### Creating branches 

```{r}
#creating git commit sending to local branch, local branch to remote main branch on git, dont wanna mess directly with main branch peopel are working on it so make side branch, lcoal branch to remote branch pushign there rather than remote main, merge into main 
# remote branch amkes changes main branch person can you review if looks good merge branch to main branchh then delete branch if you would like
#branchs provide safety check 

```
